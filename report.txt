    type Direction constructed from {up, down}

-    ElDirection(Time, Direction) is true iff at time Time the elevator has a direction Direction

-    Cchange_ElPos(Time, Floor) is true iff at time Time the elevator has a reason to change position to floor Floor
-    CNchange_ElPos(Time, Floor) is true iff at time Time the elevator has no reason to change position to floor Floor

-    Cchange_Door(Time, DoorState) is true iff at time Time the elevator has a reason to change its door Door
-    CNchange_Door(Time, DoorState) is true iff at time Time the elevator has no reason to change its door Door

-    AnswerRequest(Time, Floor) is true iff at time Time the elevator answered a request at floor Floor, currently not used but I predict I will need it at the exam

-    maxFloor: Floor is a function that always returns the highest floor Floor, used to limit the elevators reach

-    reqBelow(Time) is true iff at time Time there is an unanswered request below the elevator.
-    reqAbove(Time) is true iff at time Time there is an unanswered request above the elevator.
-    closesUAReq(Time, Floor) is true iff at time Time there is an unanswered request and it is the closest unanswered request.
-    closesUAReqBelow(Time, Floor) is true iff at time Time there is an unanswered request and it is the closest unanswered request below the elevator.
-    closesUAReqAbove(Time, Floor) is true iff at time Time there is an unanswered request and it is the closest unanswered request above the elevator.

hours spend: 30h

Major revision: no
only removed an outdated formula

Did have multiple major revision in the first 6 hours of the project, way before attempting the invariants.
